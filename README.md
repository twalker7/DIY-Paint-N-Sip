## Description

DIY Paint-N-Sip brings the fun of Paint and Sip events into the comfort of your quarantined home! Users can learn how to make a new cocktail and get artistically inspired while enjoying their drink. The user selects their favorite liquor and gets a cocktail recipe that features their choice. Now, the user can click a button to replace that cocktail if they don’t like the first option. Afterwards, they can click a button to display a work of art from the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s exclusive collection and start painting!
